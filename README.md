**Use Case: Credit Applicant Risk Prediction** 

**Title:** Credit Applicant Risk Prediction 

**Dataset**: [Credit Applicant Risk Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction)[ ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction)



**Actors:** 

1. Credit Card Applicants 
1. Financial Institution/Bank 
1. Data Scientists/Analysts 



**Preconditions:** 

I. The bank has collected sufficient application and credit records. II. Machine learning algorithms and infrastructure are available. 


# **Data Pre-processing** 
1. Data from `application\_record.csv` and `credit\_record.csv` is merged based on the Client ID. 
1. Features such as 'good' or 'bad' client labels are engineered, possibly using techniques like vintage analysis. 
# **Model Development** 
1. As data scientists, we would employ traditional logistic models as a baseline. 
1. Also, advanced machine learning algorithms (e.g., Boosting, Random Forest, SVM) are trained to refine predictions. 


# **Prediction & Decision Making** 
1. The developed model would predict the creditworthiness of new applicants. 
1. The bank uses the model’s predictions, alongside other factors, to decide credit card approvals. 


# **Feedback Loop** 
1. As new data accumulates, the model is retrained or adjusted to remain accurate. 
1. Transparent explanations for credit decisions are prepared for both applicants and regulatory purposes. 



# **Postconditions:** 

1. Applicants are either granted or denied credit based on the model’s predictions. 
1. Continuous learning ensures the model evolves with changing economic conditions and application trends. 


# **Exception** 
I. 	If economic conditions shift drastically, manual review or adjustment may be necessary to ensure model reliability. 



# **Note:** 

I. 	Handling imbalanced data will be crucial for accurate prediction. Techniques such as oversampling, under-sampling, or synthetic data generation might be needed.
